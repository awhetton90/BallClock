This application runs in the command line and takes as input a number
between 27-127 which represents the number of balls in the clock.
To exit the application from the command line, one can type 'exit' to exit.

The output displays the number of days it takes for all of the balls to cycle through until they are in the same order.
Also, the total runtime to fine that time is displayed.

For convenience, the jar file has been added to the root of this repo.
To run the problem, from the terminal at the root directory of this project
type:
`java -jar BallClock.jar`
